# NHS UK : Appointments Data Analysis

### üìã Project Brief
I conducted an in-depth analysis of NHS UK appointment data spanning 30 months (742.8M appointments) to identify service utilization patterns, assess resource capacity, and investigate missed appointments. Using Python, pandas, and statistical analysis techniques, I delivered actionable insights on appointment management.

### ‚úÖ Objectives & Analytical Approach
The analysis addressed key business needs through advanced data techniques:
- **Service Utilization Analysis**: Applied temporal pattern detection and trend analysis across 7 regions, 42 ICBs, and 106 sub-ICBs
- **Capacity Assessment**: Developed custom utilization metrics based on NHS benchmark of 1.2M daily appointments
- **Missed Appointment Investigation**: Created multivariate analysis combining appointment modes, booking intervals, and regional factors
- **External Data Evaluation**: Analyzed Twitter data to assess sentiment and public communication opportunities

### üéØ Key Findings & Business Impact
The analysis revealed significant optimization opportunities through statistical pattern identification. **Weekdays show consistent over-utilization (73% days exceeded daily capacity)**, while weekends remain under-utilized. **Face-to-face appointments** account for 78% of all missed appointments (DNA), with booking intervals strongly correlated to attendance rates (up to 4.9x difference).

**Data-Driven Recommendations:**
- Optimize booking intervals based on statistical missed appointment patterns (2.0% same-day vs. 9.8% for 28+ days)
- Expand telephone consultations that show consistent 2.5% lower missed rates across all booking windows
- Implement targeted weekend capacity to address 103%+ weekday utilization vs. 9.9%/1.1% weekend use
- Deploy region-specific strategies for high-miss areas (London's 11%+ Face-to-Face DNA rate)
- Implement automated reminder system for appointments with booking intervals >8 days

- Analyzed datasets spanning different timeframes: appointments_regional (30 months), national_categories (11 months), and actual_duration (7 months)
- Identified General Practice as the dominant service setting (91% of appointments)
- Discovered Face-to-Face (60%) and Telephone (28%) as the primary appointment modes
- Tracked the shift from Face-to-Face to Telephone, with telephone consultations doubling during COVID
- Developed custom category analysis functions to systematically examine 16 national appointment categories

### üìä Recommendations to NHS:

Based on the comprehensive data analysis, the following strategic recommendations were presented to enhance NHS appointment management:

**Operational Recommendations**
- Reduce booking intervals for Face-to-Face appointments: Statistical analysis shows 2.0% DNA rate for same-day vs. 9.8% for 28+ days
- Optimize appointment distribution: Increase 1-day appointments (currently only 1.33M/month vs. 5.36M same-day)
- Implement weekend capacity utilization: Weekend utilization data shows only 9.9% (Saturday) and 1.1% (Sunday) vs. 103%+ on weekdays
- Target high-impact regions: Midlands, London, North West and North East & Yorkshire account for 62% of missed appointments
- Deploy automated reminders for appointments with booking intervals greater than 8 days, where missed rates increase significantly

**Strategic Recommendations**
- Redistribute staff resources based on daily utilization patterns: Data shows Tuesday (107.3%) and Monday (103.6%) as highest demand days
- Promote telephone consultations: Analysis confirms consistently lower miss rates (1.4-3.3%) across all booking intervals
- Implement region-specific strategies: London shows 11%+ missed rates for face-to-face appointments while performing better with telephone
- Balance capacity across regions: Midlands manages 57.4M appointments (5.21M monthly average) vs. North West at 35.9M (3.26M monthly)
- Address post-COVID backlogs: Data shows 125% utilization peaks after lockdown periods requiring targeted intervention

**Technical Recommendations**
- Create a unified data model: Current analysis limited by inability to merge datasets at individual appointment level
- Enhance data collection: Improve segregation of healthcare professional types and geographic data points
- Implement advanced predictive modeling: Extend time series data beyond COVID recovery period for seasonal pattern identification
- Conduct granular geographic analysis: Identify and study high-performing vs. high-risk locations to reveal localized patterns
- Incorporate population demographics: Add metrics on age, major illnesses, and provider-to-patient ratios to enable deeper insights
