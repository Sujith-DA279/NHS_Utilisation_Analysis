      <h1>NHS UK : Appointments Data Analysis</h1>

      <h3>üìã Project Brief</h3>
      <p>
        I conducted an in-depth analysis of NHS UK appointment data (2020-2022) to identify service utilization patterns, assess resource capacity, and investigate missed appointments, which incur significant costs.
      </p>

      <h3>‚úÖ Objectives</h3>
      <p>
        The analysis supported key business objectives:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Understanding service utilization trends and patterns</li>
        <li>Assessing staff and capacity adequacy across regions</li>
        <li>Reducing missed appointments through targeted interventions</li>
        <li>Evaluating the value of external data sources for decision-making</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>üéØ Conclusion </h3>
      <p>
        The analysis revealed significant opportunities to improve NHS appointment utilization and reduce missed appointments. Weekdays show consistent over-utilization (73% of days exceeding capacity), while weekends are under-utilized.
      </p>
      <ul>
      <b>Key Recommendations:</b>
        <li>Increase same-day and next-day appointments to reduce missed rates</li>
        <li>Expand telephone and video consultations to optimize resources</li>
        <li>Improve weekend utilization to relieve weekday overuse</li>
        <li>Implement region-specific interventions for high-miss areas</li>
        <li>Use automated reminders for appointments with longer booking windows</li>
     </ul>

      <h4>Strategic Recommendations</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Redistribute staff resources to match peak demand periods and underutilized capacity windows</li>
        <li>Balance face-to-face and telephone appointment availability based on regional attendance patterns</li>
        <li>Consider short-term staff augmentation to address post-COVID demand surges</li>
        <li>Improve data collection methods to enable more granular analysis in the future</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Technical Recommendations</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Create a unified data model linking appointment-level data across all systems</li>
        <li>Incorporate population metrics and healthcare provider data for more comprehensive analysis</li>
        <li>Extend data collection timeframes to better identify seasonal patterns</li>
        <li>Develop advanced predictive models once post-COVID normalization periods provide more stable data</li>
      </ul>
